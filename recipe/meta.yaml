      summary: GeoViews is a Python library that makes it easy to explore and visualize geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets, such as those used in weather, climate, and remote sensing research.
      description: |
        GeoViews is built on the HoloViews library for building flexible visualizations of multidimensional data. 
        GeoViews adds a family of geographic plot types based on the Cartopy library, 
        plotted using either the Matplotlib or Bokeh packages.
